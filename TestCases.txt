Test1:
InputFile:Test1
Input:
0
0
OutPut:
Ending Program 
Purpose:
To check that if we put only 1 rental post in the inputFile that it outputs an array with
only one thing in it, and that if you put the one post that is available in there, which is
0 and 0 that it ends the program correctly.

Test2:
InputFile:Test2
Input:
1
2
0
0
OutPut:
Minimum cost to go from node 1-2: 3
Path:
1 --> 2 ($3)

Purpose:
This test case checks that the program correctly outputs the correct cheapest cost
of getting from rental place 1-2 and also prints out the path correctly. The test case
also checks that it correctly recognizes that if 2 zeros are inputted as start and ending post
that the program should be stopped.(This is also tested in every test case after this).

Test3:
InputFile:Test2
Input:
0
2
0
0
Output:
Minimum cost to go from node 0-2: 8$
PathL
0-->2 ($8)
Purpose:
This test case checks that the program correctly outputs the correct cheapest cost of getting from
rental place 0-2 and also prints out the path correctly. It also checks that instead of
going from node 0-1-2 immediately it realizes that the cheapest path is from 0-2 and uses
that so it is checking that the algorithm works as well.

Test4
InputFile:Test3
Input:
0
2
0
0
Output:
Minimum cost to go from node 0-2: ($9)
Path:
0-->1 ($6)
1-->2 ($3)
Purpose:
This test case checks that the program correctly outputs the correct cheapeast cost of
getting from rental place 0-2 and also prints the path correctly. It alos checks that
instead of going from node 0-2 immediately the program gets the correct value by
recognizing that going from 0-1-2 correctly is cheaper than 0-2 so it is essentially
checking if my algorithm is correct and that it prints correctly.

Test5
InputFile:Test3
Input:
0
2
1
2
0
0
Output:
Minimum cost to go from node 0-2: ($9)
Path:
0-->1 ($6)
1-->2 ($3)

Minimum cost to go from node 1-2: ($3)
Path:
1-->2($3)

Purpose:
This test case checks that the user is able to ascertain information that is accurate
after the first input, essentially checking that if the user wants information on the cheapest
way to get to a place starting from 2 different paths that it will give that information correctly
and will continue to do so until a 0 is input for starting rental post and ending rental post.


Test6:
InputFile:Test3
Input:
2
1
0
0
OutPut:
Error In Program Input
Purpose:
To check that our else if clause catches that if you put in a larger number for the starting post
than the ending post it will output an error

Test7:
InputFile:Test3
Input:
5
6
0
0
Output:
One of the rental posts you have inputted are invalid
the rental post go from 0 to 2
Purpose:
To check that our program catches the invalid input and outputs the correct error message.


Test8:
InputFile:No InputFile, or no outputfile.
OutPut:
There are not the right amount of files on the cmd line.
Usage: ./LColouring <input file name> <output file name>
Purpose:
To test that the check that there is an input file and output file
specified on the cmd line is correct

Test9:
InputFile:Input file not readable
OutPut:
Input file or output file could not be opened
Purpose:
To test that if the input file is not readable that the program prints the
appropriate statement


Test10:
InputFile:Ouput File not writeable or openable
OutPut:
Input file or output file could not be opened
Purpose:
To test that if the output file is not writeable that the program prints the
appropriate statement.


Test11:
InputFile:Test4
Input:
0
4
0
0
OutPut:
Minimum cost to go from 0-4: ($3)
Path:
0 -->2 ($1)
2-->3 ($1)
3-->4 ($1)
Purpose:This is just a random test case to make sure that my program works correctly
with matrixes above 3 by 3.
